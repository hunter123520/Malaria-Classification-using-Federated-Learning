# Federated Learning for Malaria Classification

This repository implements a federated learning approach for classifying malaria parasites in blood smear images. This method allows training a powerful machine learning model while preserving patient data privacy at participating healthcare institutions.

**Key Features:**

* **Federated Learning:** Trains a centralized model on decentralized datasets without directly sharing sensitive medical images.
* **Malaria Parasite Detection:** Accurately identifies the presence of malaria parasites in blood smears.
* **Privacy-Preserving AI:** Maintains patient data confidentiality during model training.

**To Run the Notebook:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/hunter123520/Malaria-Classification-using-Federated-Learning]
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. **Run the notebook:** Open **Malaria using Federated Learning.ipynb** or **Malaria.ipynb** in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
